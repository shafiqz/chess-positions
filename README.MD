## About
This is a programming challenge i did for an interview

The challenge is to count the number of unique configurations possible for a 7x7 board with 2 kings, 2 queens, 2 bishops and a knight.

## Pre-req
* JDK11
* sbt 1.2.8

## How to run
Execute sbt and then type run. Note that it can take sometime. On an 8-core(i7-8750H), it took about a minute.
